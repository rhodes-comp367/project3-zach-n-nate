# Final project

**Explain the general theme and specific features of your project.**
The general idea of our project is to create a Binary Search Tree. The basis of this project is to be able to run the code and there is an implement of the tree. So the features that is within our is that we are using nodes to determine which children goes where. If the child is less than the parent then that certain node goes to the left and if the child is greater than the parent that goes to the right. You can see this implemented starting on line 24. With that function we are showing the structure of a true BST.

**Cite any resources or existing code you used.**
Check comments in the code for the citations (Autopilot). 


**Discuss any challenges, or anything you'd like feedback on.**
The biggest challenge that we ran into was the lookup-insert function. We know it is similar but we kept running into this specific error. Something else we ran into early in our code had to with the imports. It did not like the way that we were using less than greater than, we were using symbols at first instead of typing the words out. The other challenges we ran into was trying to figure the lookup-insert function. With that one we tried our hardest and commented things out so that it can compile completely.
